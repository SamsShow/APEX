# Apex Trading Platform Improvement Roadmap

## ðŸš¨ High Priority - Critical Improvements

### Testing & Quality Assurance

- [ ] **Fix Jest Configuration Issues** - The current Babel setup is preventing proper test coverage collection
- [ ] **Increase Test Coverage** - Currently at 0% for most files; aim for 80%+ coverage on critical components
- [ ] **Add Core Component Tests** - Missing tests for `useOptionsContract`, `useOrders`, `usePositions` hooks
- [ ] **AI Component Testing** - Add tests for strategy advisor, risk assessment, and anomaly detection

### Performance & Reliability

- [ ] **Implement Error Boundaries** - Add React error boundaries throughout the application
- [ ] **Add Input Validation** - Implement comprehensive validation for all user inputs and API responses
- [ ] **Performance Caching** - Add caching layer for price feeds and market data
- [ ] **React Optimization** - Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and lazy loading for better performance

## ðŸŽ¯ Medium Priority - Feature Enhancements

### User Experience

- [ ] **Real-time Notifications** - Implement push notifications for price alerts and order updates
- [ ] **Theme Persistence** - Add dark/light theme toggle with system preference detection
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness** - Enhance mobile experience for trading interface and charts
- [ ] **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Add shortcuts for common trading actions

### Trading Features

- [ ] **Advanced Order Types** - Implement stop-loss, take-profit, and trailing stop orders
- [ ] **Portfolio Analytics** - Add detailed P&L breakdown and performance metrics
- [ ] **Risk Management** - Enhance with position sizing calculator and correlation analysis

## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements

### Architecture & Code Quality

- [ ] **State Management** - Implement proper state management (Zustand/Redux) for complex state
- [ ] **API Documentation** - Add comprehensive API docs and interactive explorer
- [ ] **Offline Support** - Implement service workers and local data caching
- [ ] **Accessibility** - Add ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support

### Advanced Features

- [ ] **Backtesting Engine** - Implement comprehensive strategy backtesting capabilities

## ðŸ“Š Current State Analysis

**Strengths:**

- Modern React/TypeScript stack
- Comprehensive AI features (sentiment analysis, anomaly detection, strategy recommendations)
- Professional UI with dark theme
- Real-time price feeds integration
- Well-structured monorepo architecture

**Critical Gaps:**

- Testing: Only 18 tests covering minimal functionality
- Error Handling: Limited error boundaries and recovery mechanisms
- Performance: No caching or optimization strategies
- Mobile: Limited mobile responsiveness
- Advanced Orders: Missing essential order types for professional trading
